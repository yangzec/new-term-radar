"""Is this term the name of a new thing, or a common word?

The signals surface whatever is new in the text they read: "Opus 5.5" and "HyperFrames",
but also "Lots", "Trained" and "voice notes". A small model reads each term with a few
places it appeared and scores it from 0 to 1; the report leads with the names.

One chat call per CHUNK terms through AIsa's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, the model set in
config.json (judge.model). Without a key, or when the call fails, the terms keep no
score and the report lists them all: the judge sorts the report, it never blocks it.
